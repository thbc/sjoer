The `PostProcessor` and its derived classes are designed for handling and manipulating a set of game objects (`InfoItem`) in a 3D space, with a focus on adjusting their positions and orientations relative to each other and the player.

1.  **Base `PostProcessor` Class:**
    
    - The `PostProcessor` class is a base class for different types of post-processors.
    - It contains a protected list of `InfoItem` objects (`infoItems`) and a `Player` object (`aligner`), indicating that it deals with information items in relation to a player.
    - The `PostProcess` method takes a list of `InfoItem` objects, assigns it to the `infoItems` field, and returns it. It seems like it's meant to be overridden in derived classes where actual processing will occur.
    - `SetAligner` method sets the `Player` object which might be used for aligning or positioning the `InfoItem` objects relative to the player's position.
    - The `Process` method is protected and virtual, implying that it's intended to be overridden in subclasses with specific processing logic.
2.  **`AISSkyPostProcessor` Class:**
    
    - This is a derived class of `PostProcessor` and overrides the `Process` method to implement specific logic for processing `InfoItem` objects.
    - The `Process` method in this class handles spatial relationships between `InfoItem` objects. It seems to deal with scenarios where multiple `InfoItem` objects might be intersecting or overlapping and adjusts their positions to resolve these overlaps.
    - The code involves checking collisions between items (using their `Collider` components), sorting them, and adjusting their positions and orientations in 3D space (possibly to prevent visual clutter or overlap in a user interface or game environment).
    - There are some commented-out sections which suggest alternative or additional logic for positioning and sorting the `InfoItem` objects, indicating that this class might be a work in progress or allows for different sorting and positioning strategies.
3.  **`AISHorizonPostProcessor` Class:**
    
    - Another derived class of `PostProcessor`.
    - The `Process` method is overridden but currently empty, suggesting this class is either a placeholder for future functionality or serves a specific purpose that doesn't require additional processing beyond what's in the base class.
